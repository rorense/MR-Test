## Tech Stacks / Packages Used

- React using Vite
  React is my preferred tech stack for web development. For this test I have used Vite to start the project.

- Axios
  Axios makes fetching data a lot easier. It's being used in the useFetch hook, used to collect data from from the provided JSON file.

- Tailwind CSS
  Prefered way of applying CSS styling. Inline styling declutters file structure and easy to see the effects.

- Redux
  Redux was used for the storing global state. Used primarily for the shopping cart feature. Redux persist, allows the state to persist even after refreshing the page

- React Hot Toast
  Toast used to inform the user if the adding products, removing products, and to ensure user selects a size before adding to card.

- Spinner
  Spinner component for loading state.

## Note

- Global styling of <p> and <h1> tags have been done on index.css file.

## Improvements for next time

Due to the limited time, there were some features that I would implement if I had more time:

- Use TypeScript instead of JavaScript for type checking.
- Introduce automated tests.

#TODO:

- Automated tests
- Deployment
